      <h1>CONTEMPORARY</h1>

      <h2>K-12 Changes and Uneven Effectiveness</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The K-12 program, meant to meet global standards, was implemented in 2012, but its execution was highly flawedâ€”for instance, many schools did not have the requisite classrooms to be fully staffed.</li>
        <li>Students from marginalized rural and urban poor communities have been disproportionately impacted by implementation gaps, which perpetuate entrenched inequities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructional Gaps and the Legacy of Colonization</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The use of English as the primary language of instruction, stemming from colonial rule, remains entrenched.</li>
        <li>Policy-based support for mother-tongue instruction is not translated in practice due to untrained and resource-poor teachers.</li>
        <li>This exacerbates low reading competencies and high dropout rates, as shown in national assessments and international studies like PISA.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Digital Gap and Realities After the Pandemic</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The digital gap became evident during the pandemic's shift to online learning, with rural and low-income students facing lack of internet, gadgets, and stable electricity.</li>
        <li>While inadequate digital infrastructure persists, blended learning is here to stay.</li>
        <li>The Education Department faces competing demands: upgrading digital infrastructure while ensuring no students are left behind.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Access to Education and Social Class Divides</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Private schools remain the choice for elite and middle-class families, while public schools are underfunded and overcrowded.</li>
        <li>Low-income students face the greatest hurdles in accessing quality education, reflecting colonial and elitist roots of the system.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Moving Forward with an Awareness of History</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Addressing current educational issues requires dismantling systemic frameworks rooted in colonial history.</li>
        <li>Future reforms must be inclusive and relevant to the diverse cultures of all Filipinos, avoiding shallow adoption of foreign models.</li>
      </ul>
