        <div className="w-full flex justify-center"><img src={im1} className="h-64 w-96  rounded-2xl" /></div>

        <ul>
          <li>The K-12 program, meant to meet global standards, was implemented in 2012, but its execution was highly flawedâ€”for instance, many schools did not have the requisite classrooms to be fully staffed.</li>
          <li>Students from marginalized rural and urban poor communities have been disproportionately impacted by implementation gaps, which perpetuate entrenched inequities.</li>

        <h2 className="font-semibold text-center text-lg mb-2">Instructional Gaps and the Legacy of Colonization</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The use of English as the primary language of instruction, stemming from colonial rule, remains entrenched.</li>
          <li>Policy-based support for mother-tongue instruction is not translated in practice due to untrained and resource-poor teachers.</li>
          <li>This exacerbates low reading competencies and high dropout rates, as shown in national assessments and international studies like PISA.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The digital gap became evident during the pandemic's shift to online learning, with rural and low-income students facing lack of internet, gadgets, and stable electricity.</li>
          <li>While inadequate digital infrastructure persists, blended learning is here to stay.</li>
          <li>The Education Department faces competing demands: upgrading digital infrastructure while ensuring no students are left behind.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Private schools remain the choice for elite and middle-class families, while public schools are underfunded and overcrowded.</li>
          <li>Low-income students face the greatest hurdles in accessing quality education, reflecting colonial and elitist roots of the system.</li>

        <h2 className="font-semibold text-center text-lg mb-2">Moving Forward with an Awareness of History</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Addressing current educational issues requires dismantling systemic frameworks rooted in colonial history.</li>
          <li>Future reforms must be inclusive and relevant to the diverse cultures of all Filipinos, avoiding shallow adoption of foreign models.</li>
