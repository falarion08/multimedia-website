      <h1>Philippine Colonial Education System</h1>

      <h2>Spanish Period</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Colonized for 333 years</li>
        <li>Spaniards entered the Philippine Islands in 1521</li>
        <li>Surprised that the native population had high literacy, knowing how to read and write using a 17-symbol alphabet called the Baybayin, though education was not formal. </li>
        <li>The native people were more focused on teaching practical knowledge that goes with their worship of Bathala (Local Deity) and the respect of laws and customs.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Spaniards then introduce formal education</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In 1565, the Spanish friars and missionaries arrived.</li>
        <li>Built churches and schools</li>
        <li>Priests as first teachers, converting the native people to Catholicism.</li>
        <li>The formal education was religion-based and controlled by the Roman Catholic Church.</li>
        <li>First to arrive were the Augustinians in Cebu in 1565, followed by the Franciscans in 1577, Jesuits in 1581, and Dominicans in 1587.</li>
        <li>In 1590, the Jesuits established Colegio de Manila, later renamed as Unibersidad de San Ignacio.</li>
        <li>Next was the University of Santo Tomas, the oldest existing university in the Philippines and in Asia. Founded by the Dominicans on April 28, 1611.</li>
        <li>The friars also taught Latin and Spanish grammar (languages and in religious ceremonies).</li>
        <li>“The Spanish educational system was meant to keep the natives faithful, in order to keep the Church’s authority over the lives of the Indios (Colonized Filipinos)”.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>American Period</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Began in 1898, following Spain’s defeat in the Spanish-American War.</li>
        <li>Introduced a centralized public school system in 1901 through Act No. 74.</li>
        <li>Around 1,000 American teachers (the “Thomasites”) arrived to establish the system.</li>
        <li>Education became secularized, and English became the primary language of instruction in public schools.</li>
        <li>The University of the Philippines was established in 1908.</li>
        <li>Emphasized democratic ideals and civic education.</li>
        <li>Led to high English proficiency among Filipinos and created a lasting legacy patterned after the American model.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Japanese Occupation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Occupation lasted from 1942 to 1945 during World War II.</li>
        <li>Japanese authorities discouraged English, promoted the Japanese language (Nippongo), and fostered Filipino-Japanese cultural ties as part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</li>
        <li>A Department of Instruction was established, later becoming the Department of Education in 1947.</li>
        <li>Reforms included promoting Filipino culture, vocational education, and moral development, but they had minimal lasting impact due to the short wartime period and heavy disruptions.</li>
      </ul>
